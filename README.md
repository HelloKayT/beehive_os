# Beehive

Beehive is a NoC-based hardware network stack. It is architected with modular, flexible, and 
scalable hardware network stack implementations in order to better support future network-attached accelerators. 
The goal is to support complex network protocols at L4+ alongside the variety of packet processing functionality 
that modern microservice-style applications rely on such as network virtualization.

This is the future home of the open-source version of the Beehive code
